# A11 exact-head regression seal (2026-09-01)

This record separates the tested code head from the registry-only seal. It does
not turn an expected freshness failure into a passing run.

## Tested code head

- Commit: `8171fdb5e4c64b7092f68818f3702f824eb0b435`
- Studio T0 job: `20260902-021748-t0-8171fdb5-r2`
- Host: `Mac17,9`, macOS `26.5`
- Public receipt outcome: `failed`, `pass=false`
- Retained `check.log` SHA-256:
  `f74cbafad43de1bd64fc0b2f745016e76c8b76926d5a643098ebe9c913b1f110`

The deterministic project check ran to completion. Its only failed step was
`capability registry`, which rejected the deliberately stale `tested_commit`.
Every other project-check section passed. The registry-only seal updates that
pointer and regenerates the derived status blocks; its own hosted checks must
still be green before the seal is treated as complete.

An earlier T0 job, `20260902-021510-t0-8171fdb5`, was interrupted when the
queue worker was forcibly restarted after claiming it. Its worktree and output
directory moved while the child check was still running, so it produced no
published receipt. That failed experiment remains in the queue record and is
not used as evidence.

## Hosted checks at the tested code head

- Security and quality run `33582509854`: `success`. All five jobs passed:
  loom, graphics compatibility claims, fuzz corpus smoke, supply-chain policy
  and live-gate policy.
- CI run `33582509937`: `failure`. All independent code, build and test jobs
  passed; only `capability and documentation drift` failed because the registry
  and its generated blocks still named the earlier tested commit.

The code-head CI failure is retained. It is not a green seal and cannot promote
live evidence. The registry-only commit must be pushed and its exact SHA must
receive successful hosted CI and Security results.

## Explicitly open

The hosted QMP campaign at code head run `33582528722` is exploratory until the
same exact green seal passes the full 20/20 negative control and 60/60 workspace
rounds and its artifact is independently verified. The audio teardown 10-run
campaign, M1/M2/M3 clean-machine matrix, 20-workload compatibility matrix, A9
Windows kernel acceptance and complete app-driven install/recovery E2E also
remain open. Product state therefore remains Engineering Preview.
