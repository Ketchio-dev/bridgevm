## Why this document exists

The live HVF firmware smokes (`tests/integration/windows-arm-hvf-real-edk2-*`)
load **QEMU's** ArmVirtQemu firmware build:

```
FIRMWARE = /opt/homebrew/Cellar/qemu/11.0.1/share/qemu/edk2-aarch64-code.fd
VARS     = /opt/homebrew/Cellar/qemu/11.0.1/share/qemu/edk2-arm-vars.fd
```

That firmware does **not** boot on an arbitrary platform. ArmVirtQemu discovers
its world from the device tree QEMU hands it and from the `fw_cfg` device, and it
installs the **guest ACPI tables that QEMU generates and exposes through
`fw_cfg`** (`etc/acpi/tables`, `etc/acpi/rsdp`, `etc/table-loader`). It expects a
GICv3 (with an ITS for MSI), a `pci-host-ecam-generic` root complex, PL011/PL031,
and flash banks — all at the QEMU `virt` addresses, described by a QEMU-shaped DTB.

Originally `bridgevm-hvf` presented almost none of that and loaded QEMU's firmware
onto a **non-QEMU platform**. That mismatch — not a firmware bug — was the root
cause of the `try-recommended-vbar` / `low-vector-repair` /
`restore-before-eret` / `diagnostic` vector-patching seen in the early firmware
run-loop smokes: the firmware faulted early because the hardware underneath it was
not the hardware it was built for, and the run loop tried to patch around the
faults instead of supplying the contract.

> **Windows 11 ARM consumes ACPI, not a device tree.** A DTB handed to the
> *firmware* is fine and expected (that is how ArmVirtQemu works); the DTB just has
> to describe the QEMU-shaped platform, including the `fw_cfg` and PCIe nodes, so
> the firmware can emit ACPI for the guest. The current DTB does neither.

## The authoritative contract (regenerate it yourself)

Everything below was dumped from the **exact** QEMU the smokes use, so it is the
real contract, not from memory:

```sh
qemu-system-aarch64 -machine virt,gic-version=3,dumpdtb=virt.dtb \
  -cpu cortex-a72 -m 6144 -smp 4
dtc -I dtb -O dts virt.dtb -o virt.dts
```

A decompiled reference copy is checked in at
[`docs/reference/qemu-virt-aarch64-gicv3.dts`](reference/qemu-virt-aarch64-gicv3.dts).
Re-dump it whenever the bundled QEMU version changes — the addresses are stable
across recent QEMU releases but the ECAM/highmem layout can shift with options.

### QEMU `virt` device map (GICv3, QEMU 11.0.1)

GIC: `gic-version=3`, `#interrupt-cells = <3>`, ITS is `msi-controller`.

### Legacy `bridgevm-hvf` probe map (`crates/bridgevm-hvf/src/lib.rs`)

## The original gap, side by side

| Capability | QEMU `virt` (the firmware's contract) | `bridgevm-hvf` today | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **`fw_cfg`** | `0x0902_0000`, `qemu,fw-cfg-mmio` | **absent** (0 references) | **MISSING — keystone.** No path for the guest ACPI tables, SMBIOS, boot order, kernel/initrd. ArmVirtQemu has nothing to install → ACPI-dependent Windows cannot boot. |
| **PCIe ECAM** | `pci-host-ecam-generic` @ `0x40_1000_0000` | **absent** (0 references) | **MISSING.** No NVMe, no virtio-pci, no MSI-targeted devices. |
| **GIC ITS (MSI)** | `its@8080000`, `msi-controller` | **absent** | **MISSING.** No MSI/MSI-X for PCIe devices. |
| GIC distributor | `0x0800_0000` (in-kernel `hv_gic` or modelled) | userspace skeleton @ `0x1001_0000` | MISMATCH — wrong base, and a hand-rolled model (see [strategy](hvf-windows-engine-strategy.md)). |
| GIC redistributor | `0x080A_0000` | userspace skeleton @ `0x1002_0000` | MISMATCH. |
| pflash (code) | `0x0000_0000` | `0x0800_0000` | MISMATCH — bridgevm's code pflash sits exactly where QEMU puts the **GIC distributor**. |
| PCIe 32-bit MMIO window | `0x1000_0000` | reused as the device MMIO window | COLLISION. |
| PL011 / PL031 | `0x0900_0000` / `0x0901_0000` | inside the `0x1000_0000` window | MISMATCH (address). |
| virtio transport | virtio-**mmio** @ `0x0A00_0000`, 0x200 stride | virtio-mmio @ `0x1000_2000`/`0x1000_3000` | MISMATCH (base, stride, count); and virtio-mmio is the wrong transport for an inbox-driver Windows install (see strategy). |
| RAM base | `0x4000_0000` | `0x4000_0000` | ✅ **MATCH — the only one.** |

**Original bottom line:** of QEMU `virt`'s entire device map, the legacy HVF probe
map reproduced only the RAM base. The two genuinely missing subsystems —
`fw_cfg` and PCIe ECAM (+ ITS) — were precisely the ones that gated ACPI and
storage, i.e. the ones that gate Windows booting at all.

## What this implies (see the strategy doc for the decision)

There are two coherent ways to stop loading QEMU firmware onto a non-QEMU platform.
The chosen direction is **Path A — converge on the QEMU `virt` contract** so the
stock `edk2-aarch64-code.fd` boots unmodified and the guest ACPI/PCIe/Windows-media
behaviour matches the QEMU stack that already installs Windows 11 ARM. Rationale,
the rejected alternative (Path B, own platform + own EDK2 + hand-written ACPI), and
the sequenced plan live in
[`docs/hvf-windows-engine-strategy.md`](hvf-windows-engine-strategy.md).

Path A now has `fw_cfg`, a QEMU-shaped DTB, Apple `hv_gic`, PL011, PL031, empty
virtio-mmio slots, PCIe ECAM host-bridge config space, and a minimal P30 pflash
vars model wired behind `VirtPlatform::on_mmio()`. The stock ArmVirtQemu firmware
boots to the UEFI shell. The remaining gap is above firmware: ACPI table-loader
delivery, real PCIe endpoints/BAR routing, NVMe, and then Linux ACPI / Windows
installer validation.
