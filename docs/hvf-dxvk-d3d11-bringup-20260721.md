# DXVK D3D11 on Venus — bring-up status (2026-07-21)

## Status

Open, far advanced in one day. An ARM64 build of upstream DXVK 3.0.2 now
creates a **D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_11_0** device on the Venus adapter inside the
Windows ARM64 guest, compiles HLSL through DXBC into SPIR-V, submits the draw,
and completes a GPU EVENT query — the remaining wall is that the first draw
rasterizes nothing (clear-black readback), with the relaxed `nullDescriptor`
null-binding path as the prime suspect.

## How it runs

- DXVK upstream (commit `0ff9cd3`) is ARM64-aware; cross-built on macOS with
  llvm-mingw 20260616 (`scripts/win-tests/dxvk-build-winarm64.txt` is the meson
  cross file; toolchain under `~/BridgeVM/toolchains/`). Build dir:
  `~/BridgeVM/dxvk/build.arm64`.
- The relax patch `scripts/patches/dxvk-macos-venus-relax.patch` turns five
  hard requirements into reduced-caps: `geometryShader`,
  `shaderCullDistance` (Metal has no geometry stage), `depthClipEnable`
  (extension absent in MoltenVK), `robustBufferAccess2`+`nullDescriptor`
  (robustness2 features false), and `khrSwapchain` (see below). This mirrors
  the DXVK-macOS approach on a current ARM64-capable codebase.
- Guest side: `scripts/win-tests/bridgevm-d3d11-draw-smoke.c` runs from
  `C:\BridgeVM\dxvk\` so the local DXVK d3d11/dxgi win the loader search;
  firstboot stage 3 runs it non-gating with `DXVK_LOG_PATH=C:\BridgeVM\dxvk`.

## The diagnosis chain that got here (each step one bounded guest run)

1. `E_FAIL`, no DXVK logs → added `DXVK_LOG_PATH`: DXVK loads, finds the Venus
   device, but "Device does not support Vulkan 1.3".
2. Device advertised 1.2: Venus clamps to 1.2 when `VK_KHR_synchronization2`
   is off, and the WDDM port gates sync2 (like all
   `VN_USE_WSI_PLATFORM` builds) on sync-fd semaphore import it lacks. Fixed
   guest-side in driver **120.38** (`mesa-venus-wddm-sync2.patch`): the WDDM
   port presents through KMD scanout, not sync-fd WSI semaphores, so sync2
   stays on and the device advertises **1.3.334** (verified by the Vulkan draw
   smoke, which now requests 1.3 — its old 1.1 request had been self-clamping
   the reported version).
3. Next skip: `depthClipEnable` → static diff of all DXVK required features
   against MoltenVK found exactly `depthClipEnable`, `robustBufferAccess2`,
   `nullDescriptor` remaining → relaxed.
4. Next skip: `khrSwapchain` — the same guest sync-fd gate blocks
   `VK_KHR_swapchain` exposure. Relaxed in DXVK for offscreen bring-up; the
   real fix (exposing swapchain without sync-fd import, or implementing
   driver-side external semaphores) is the presentation-path work and is
   REQUIRED before any windowed D3D11 app can present.
5. Device creation succeeded at FL 11_0; draw executes but reads back black.

## Alongside: driver 120.37/120.38 and the timing baseline

- **120.37** retired the temporary Mesa D3D bring-up beacons (builder chain
  verified locally to still apply); all Vulkan gates stayed green with
  unchanged checksums.
- The draw smoke gained a present-free draw/fence loop. Baselines, 300 frames,
  64x64 offscreen: **host MoltenVK 5646 fps (min 138 us / max 360 us)**;
  **guest via Venus 45-47 fps (min ~1.7 ms / max ~88 ms)** — a ~120x
  fence-roundtrip overhead that quantifies the transport optimization target
  (fence batching / submit coalescing leads in the perf plan).
- **120.38** = 120.37 + `mesa-venus-wddm-sync2.patch`; Vulkan gates and bench
  unchanged (45.49 fps), device api now 1.3.334.

## Next work

1. Black first-draw: determine whether the relaxed `nullDescriptor` breaks
   DXVK's null-binding handling for the no-vertex-buffer draw — try a
   vertex-buffered variant of the d3d11 smoke, then DXVK debug logging; if
   confirmed, implement null-descriptor emulation or scope DXVK config.
2. Presentation: expose `VK_KHR_swapchain` in the guest driver without
   sync-fd import (driver-side external semaphore per the Mesa TODO), then
   drop the DXVK khrSwapchain relax and run a windowed D3D11 present test.
3. Then the rung-4 flag: a real DX11 title.

Evidence: `~/BridgeVM/runs/venus-activate-120.38-dxvk4-*` (final run) and the
`venus-activate-120.37-*`/`-120.38-*` chain before it.
